<p>To output text to the console, use the <code>System.out.println</code>; this is equivalent to <code>console.log</code> in JavaScript, e.g:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello world"</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Try printing out Hello world (like above) and if it works try printing out your own custom messages. Remember to put it in the <code>main</code> method. Notice that once you type in System.out followed by a full stop you will get many different options popping up, this is simply the interpreter, offering you suggestions for what to type, for now we will only be interested in two of these; print and println.  Print simply prints out whatever you have inserted in speech marks. However if you do println like we have done above then Hello world will be printed and then we will have a new line (like when you hit enter in word), here the ln stands for “line new”.</p>
<p>Try the following, which will do exactly the same, but in more lines of code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">System.out.print(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello "</span>);
System.out.print(<span class="hljs-string">"world"</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Now, what about if we wanted to put the world on a new line?  Well we would simply write the following code instead:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>);
System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"world"</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Which would print Hello then a new line, and then print world on that new line.</p>
<p>You can also print out variables, when you print out a variable you do not need to add “” or &#39; &#39; you simply put the variable name inside the the brackets.  So if you had an int <code>n</code> which is equal to 5, you could print it out using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">System.out.println(n);</code></pre>
<p>You could also print out variables and Strings at the same time, you simply separate them with a <code>+</code> sign as shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-java">System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"The value of n is "</span> + n);</code></pre>
<h4 id="ex-1">Ex 1</h4>
<p>Write a program to print a simple drawing of a house, once you have done that have some fun and see what else you can draw!
Hint: Use <code>*</code> or <code>+</code> or another symbol and the <code>println</code> function.</p>
